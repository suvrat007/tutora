# Tutora

A CRM (Consumer Relation Model) especially curated for small scale private tuition teacher's student logs like attendance, fees, contact information etc.

This platform will provide every educator to build a website that has their institute's branding on it promoting their feeling of self pride and support their dream of have a website of their own.

Due to the complexity of the project it's divided into phases
    
- PHASE-1 : 
  - Allows user to establish their own website.
  - Contains basic CRUD features for Batches and Students.
  - Allows user to manage and access each student's attendance.
  - Manages any sort of reminder the user want to set for the future, etc.
  
- PHASE-2 : (as per present plan)
    - Will provide user the facility to manage and keep track of fees submitted by students.
    - Students Portal
